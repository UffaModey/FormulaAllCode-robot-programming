Here are some Python programs for controlling the Formula AllCode robot using some of its seensors.

- **Follow The Line** enables the Formula AllCode robot to follow a black line drawn on the floor. The robot is placed in a start position and waits until a clap sound is identified. This is its trigger to start moving. It stops when a gap is identified, and displays the total travel time on the screen. 

- **Searching For The Light**  enables the Formula AllCode robot to follow a light source that is cast on the robot. The light source acts a motion trigger for the robot. It changes direction to a position with light intesity that is greater than a set treshold. The robot stops moving when it does not sense the light. 

- **Maze Solving Robot** is still in development. The Formula AllCode Robot is programmed to solve a 6 x 6 maze using left walling following.
