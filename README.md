# follow-the-line-FormulaAllCode-robot
Follow The Line is a Python program for the Formula AllCode robot to enable it to follow a black line drawn on the floor. 

The robot is placed in a start position and waits until a clap sound is identified. This is its trigger to start moving. It stops when a gap is identified, and displays the total travel time on the screen.
