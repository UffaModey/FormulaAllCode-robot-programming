# follow-the-line-FormulaAllCode-robot
Follow The Line describes the program for the Formula AllCode robot to follow the black line drawn on the floor. 

The robot is placed in a start position and waits until a clap sound is identified, it stops when a gap is identified, and displays the total travel time on the screen.
